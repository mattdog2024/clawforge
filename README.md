# Forge

**Local AI agent desktop app** — chat, IM bridge, scheduled tasks. Powered by Claude Agent SDK.

Forge gives you a full desktop GUI for Claude agents, with the ability to bridge your agent to messaging platforms (Feishu, Telegram, Discord) and schedule automated tasks — all running locally on your machine.

## Features

- **Desktop Chat** — Real-time conversation with Claude agents, streaming responses, tool call visualization, file diff preview, code syntax highlighting
- **Multimodal** — Upload images, PDFs, code files, documents. Agent sees the actual content (not just filenames)
- **IM Bridge** — Bridge your agent to Feishu, Telegram, and Discord. Chat with your agent from your phone. Receive/send images and files
- **Scheduled Tasks** — Cron-based task scheduling with IM notification delivery. Heartbeat monitoring with customizable checklists
- **Project Workspaces** — Each project folder gets its own agent personality, memory, and configuration
- **Memory System** — MEMORY.md index (first 200 lines auto-loaded) + topic files (on-demand) + Agent-driven daily logs. Aligned with Claude Code's auto memory architecture
- **`/init` Interview** — Conversational workspace setup: Agent asks 6 questions, then generates personalized config files from pre-filled templates (behavioral guidelines, session rules, memory norms)
- **Skills & Agents** — Global skills/agents shared across projects (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/agents/`), compatible with Claude Code
- **Multi-Provider** — Claude Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax, Qwen, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Bilingual** — Full Chinese and English UI

## Tech Stack

- **Desktop**: Electron + Next.js 15 (Turbopack)
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL mode)
- **AI**: Claude Agent SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+
- Claude Code CLI installed (for OAuth authentication) or an Anthropic API key

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feicaiclub/forge.git
cd forge
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts both the Next.js dev server and the Electron app.

### Build & Package

```bash
# Build for macOS (Apple Silicon)
pnpm package:mac
```

The `.dmg` file will be in the `release/` directory.

> **Note**: The pre-built DMG is for Apple Silicon (arm64) only. Intel Mac users need to build from source.

> **Note**: The app is ad-hoc signed (not notarized). On first launch, right-click the app → "Open" → confirm to bypass Gatekeeper.

### Data Storage

All application data is stored locally at `~/.forge/`:
- `forge.db` — SQLite database (sessions, messages, settings). Auto-created on first launch.
- `workspaces/` — Workspace config file copies (`.claude/` snapshots)

No data is sent to any server other than the AI provider APIs you configure.
